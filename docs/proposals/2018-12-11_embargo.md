# Adding embargo to content_restrictions trait

# Problem

When a third party and the news organization agreed to hold a story from publishing until a certain time or certain conditions which have met, currently we don't have the ability to implement this kind of publishing restriction (i.e. news embargo). Therefore this proposal is to provide a way for the authoring applications to apply embargoes.

# Proposal

We propose to add a new `embargo` object which contains active, start_time, end_time, and description properties to the content_restrictions trait.

### embargo in the trait_content_restrictions

```
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
  "id": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/ans-schema/master/src/main/resources/schema/ans/0.8.1/traits/trait_content_restrictions.json",
  "title": "Content Restrictions",
  "description": "Trait that applies contains the content restrictions of an ANS object.",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    ...,
    "embargo": {
      "description": "Embargo configuration to enforce publishing restrictions",
      "type": "object",
      "additionalProperties": false,
      "properties": {
        "active": {
          "type": "boolean",
          "description": "The boolean flag to indicate if the embargo is active or not"
        },
        "start_time": {
          "type": "string",
          "format": "date-time",
          "description": "An optional start time for the embargo to indicate when it starts. When it's not defined, it means the embargo applies right away. The start time should be ignored if active flag is false."
        },
        "end_time": {
          "type": "string",
          "format": "date-time",
          "description": "An optional end time for the embargo to indicate when it ends. When it's not defined, it means the embargo keeps applying. The end time should be ignored if active flag is false."
        },
        "description": {
          "description": "An optional description for the embargo.",
          "type": "string"
        },
      },
      "required": [ "active" ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Sample Embargo
**Case 1: active embargo without the start and end time**
```
{
  "type": "story",
  "version": "0.8.1",
  "content_restrictions": {
    "embargo": {
      "active": true,
      "description": "Can't publish until company X announces the new product Z..."
    }
  }
}
```
In this case, we should not allow publishing or schedule publishing for the story.

**Case 2: active embargo with the end time in the future**
```
{
  "type": "story",
  "version": "0.8.1",
  "content_restrictions": {
    "embargo": {
      "active": true,
      "end_time": "2018-12-31T05:00:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```
Assuming today is 12/11/2018, in this case, we should not allow publishing now but allow schedule publishing after `2018-12-31T05:00:00Z` for the story.

**Case 3: active embargo with the end time in the past**
```
{
  "type": "story",
  "version": "0.8.1",
  "content_restrictions": {
    "embargo": {
      "active": true,
      "end_time": "2018-11-30T05:00:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```
Assuming today is 12/11/2018, in this case, we should allow publishing and schedule publishing for the story.

**Case 4: inactive embargo with the end time**
```
{
  "type": "story",
  "version": "0.8.1",
  "content_restrictions": {
    "embargo": {
      "active": false,
      "end_time": "2020-11-30T05:00:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```
In this case, the embargo is not active, so we should allow publishing and schedule publishing for the story.

# Concerns

No

# Implementation

Cheng-Hsin Weng from Ellipsis team will implement this and add it to the schema if this proposal is accepted.
