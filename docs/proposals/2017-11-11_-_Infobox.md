# Problem

Many articles across many publishers have a need to supply arbitrary field-value data to readers. This may include details of a movie being reviewed, or a political district.

# Proposal

A new content element `infobox` that allows arbitrary, non-queryable, key-value pairs.

## `infobox` element

A new content element `infobox` will be added, with the following fields:

* `fields` -- an array of pairs of text elements (`field_name` and `field_value`)
* `title` -- a single text element, indicating a title at the top of the box

Neither `title` nor `fields` is required.

Templates and UIs will need to be able to render and support any arbitrary set of fields or titles.


## Example
```
{
  "type": "infobox",
  "title": {
    "type": "text",
    "content": "Movie Details"
  },
  "fields": [
    {
        "field_name": {
          "type": "text",
          "content": "Title"
        },
        "field_value": {
          "type": "text",
          "content": "Justice League"
        }
    },
    {
        "field_name": {
          "type": "text",
          "content": "Written By"
        },
        "field_value": {
          "type": "text",
          "content": "Chris Terrio, Joss Whedon and Zack Snyder"
        }
    }
  ]
}
```


## Concerns

### Is this queryable?

No.

### Why text elements? Isn't that a lot of overhead?

It is preferable if things like bold, italics, or other HTML formatting is expected.

### Is any alignment or formatting implied by the association of data within an 'infobox'?

Only that the data should be grouped together, the order of fields should be preserved, and that each field name and field value are included. If alignment is necessary, the table element is preferable.
