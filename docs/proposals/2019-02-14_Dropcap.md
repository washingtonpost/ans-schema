# Dropcap for paragraph and heading elements

# Problem

Users want the ability to add a dropcap to paragraphs and headings.

# Proposal

we propose adding a new trait, `formating` to text and heading content elements, which will contain the new property `dropcap`.

`dropcap` will accept a string value of `letter` or `word`.
 * `letter` implies to apply the dropcap formating to the first letter of the first word of the content element.
 * `word` implies to apply the dropcap formating to the entire first word of the content element.

# Trait in ANS Schema

# Examples
```
content_elements: [{
  additional_properties: {}
  alignment: "left"
  channels: ["basic", "print"]
  content: "bla bla bla"
  level: 1
  type: "header"
  formating: {
    dropcap: "letter"
  }
  _id: "KKAE5ETLOVBLXCU7ZI4ELLVUJM"
}]
```

# Concerns

## How will this function with the user's ability to do html inline styling?

Currently, within ellipsis we allow html styling (bold, italic, ect.). How will we handle when text phrase has `dropcap` as well as an additional inline style.

# Alternatives Considered


# Implementation
